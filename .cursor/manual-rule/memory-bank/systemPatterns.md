# System Patterns

## System Architecture
- Modular microservices for audio processing, speech-to-text, information extraction, and summarization.
- RESTful API endpoints for frontend-backend communication.
- Asynchronous task processing for scalability (e.g., Celery, background workers).
- Persistent storage for audio, transcriptions, and extracted information.

## Key Technical Decisions
- Use of state-of-the-art speech recognition models (e.g., Whisper, Vosk).
- Integration of NLP models for summarization and entity extraction (e.g., BART, T5).
- FastAPI for backend API development.
- React (or similar) for frontend development.

## Design Patterns
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA).
- Repository pattern for database access.
- Adapter pattern for integrating multiple speech/NLP models.
- Factory pattern for task orchestration.

## Component Relationships
- Audio input flows to speech-to-text service.
- Transcribed text flows to information extraction and summarization services.
- Results are stored and made available via API and UI.
